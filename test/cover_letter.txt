Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at Cisco ThousandEyes. As a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to the table. My previous experience in deploying AI solutions has taught me the importance of understanding the requirements of the job and tailoring my approach accordingly.

In my current position at Valeo-Egypt, I have successfully deployed an AI solution with two primary functions: automating the generation of daily and monthly issue reports, reducing manual effort by 60%, and developing an AI-based system for Jira ticket classification and auto-resolution, maintaining high accuracy while reducing resolution time by 30%. I have also created AI-driven expert systems to monitor telecom operations and recommend optimal solutions to problems, reducing manual effort for telecom engineers by 30%. Additionally, I designed intelligent systems and tools for RF planning and optimization, enhancing decision-making processes. These experiences have honed my ability to develop innovative solutions that drive business success.

My education in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering has provided me with a solid foundation in programming & frameworks (Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers), NLP & LLM expertise (fine-tuning Transformer-based models, prompt engineering, text classification, sentiment analysis), and AI & ML expertise (sequence modeling, transfer learning, few-shot and zero-shot learning, model deployment). My technical skills and knowledge have enabled me to develop and deploy machine learning models with ease.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join Cisco ThousandEyes and work on a confidential product that seeks to adopt a highly novel and ambitious approach for optimizing networks to better serve applications. As a team, we will be designing and implementing large-scale machine learning pipelines using Python as well as a wide range of internal tools built on top of Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and other Big Data technologies. I bring a deep understanding of the intricacies inherent in machine learning systems and the ability to transform abstract concepts into robust, efficient, and scalable solutions.

Cisco values diversity and inclusivity, and I am eager to contribute to a workplace culture that fosters collaboration, creativity, and innovation. As an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer, Cisco considers qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records for employment.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your requirements.

Sincerely,
[Bassant Elsayed]
